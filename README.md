# Rcpp-Framework-for-GLM-of-Bernoulli-variables
This GitHub Repository provides C++ code that can be used in R, using the Rcpp framework for compilation, to estimate parameters of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using the canonical link function for outcome variables following a bernoulli distribution.

When using 10 iterations for the Newton-Raphson's method to perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters, the proposed code achieves a performance of approximately 4 times faster than the GLM R package for both Beta estimation and Beta testing.
